# Lab Report 1
## For each of the commands cd, ls, and cat, and using the workspace you created in this lab:

`cd`
- Share an example of using the command with no arguments.

  + the file directory before was lecture1 and after putting in `cd` with no arguments, it went back to the home directory
  + `cd` is used for going to a specific directory and if it's used with no arguments, it goes back to the main directory since there was no directoy specified as an argument
- Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

  + the file directory before was the home directory and when I used `cd` with the argument "lecture1" it switched the directory to the lecture1 folder
  + since this time, `cd` was used with a specific directory as an argument, it switched to the specified directory as it functions to do so
- Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

`ls`
- Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
- Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
- Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

`cat`
- Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
- Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
- Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
So that's 9 total examples (3 for each command). For each of the 9 examples, include:

## Include a screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output for each example (9).
- What the absolute path to the working directory was right before the command was run.
- A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
- Indicate explicitly whether the output is an error or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error in one or two sentences.
  Note: Make sure to use backticks ` around keywords such as commands, file names, paths, etc. to make them show up as code like cd.
